# UFOs

## Overview:
For this project, we wanted to create a website that allows for someone to filter through a dataset of UFO sightings. We want there to be multiple filter criteria to narrow the search down as much as desired. We use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fully functional website that allows for the user to search for specific sightings based on the different filter options.

## Results:
When you enter onto the page, there is a short paragraph detailing the purpose of our dataset. Below, there is a table full of the data and filters set to the side for the user to experiment with. The filter options are date, city, state, country, and shape. The user can use one or more of these filters to get to the desired sighting. Every time a filter is added, the table data gets smaller and smaller as it narrows down the field of options ot fit the description of what the user is looking for. 

## Summary:
A drawback of this new design is that there are more ways for the user to accidentally input the wrong information. Before, there was only the date filter, so if the user accidentally input the wrong information or the wrong format, it would be easy to understand what was wrong. But if a user inputs all of the information at once now, it may be more difficult to determine which filter is causing the lack of information. A recommendation I have for further development is having the data split up onto different pages so that the webpage isn't so long. Another recommendation that I have is for the duration of the sighting to also be a filter criteria. I think that it would be helpful to sort the short sightings from the longer sightings.
